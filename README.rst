About kovit
===========

kovit is a generic markov chain library that allows for easy incremental chain building.

kovit comes with fast iterator utilities written in C/C++ which can be used to build a
markov chain from a stream of objects produced by a python iterable or generator.

Random chain walks based on trailing item probability are implemented for easy sequence generation.

WIP, more documentation to come when my hand is not broken.
